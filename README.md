# Personal Protfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site was built using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS, and serves as a showcase of my work as a developer.

The purpose of this website is to provide an overview of my skills, experience, and projects. Visitors can browse my portfolio and see examples of my work, including websites, applications, and other programming projects.

In addition to showcasing my work, this website also provides information about me as a developer. Visitors can learn about my background, skills, and interests, as well as my approach to software development and my philosophy on technology.

I chose to build this website using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS because I believe these technologies offer a powerful combination of flexibility, scalability, and interactivity. With ReactJS, I was able to build a responsive and dynamic user interface that enables visitors to easily navigate my portfolio and learn about my work. HTML and CSS provided me with the tools to create a visually appealing and professional-looking website that showcases my skills as a designer and developer.

Overall, I am proud of this website and I hope that it provides visitors with a clear understanding of who I am as a developer and what I can offer as a collaborator or employee.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
